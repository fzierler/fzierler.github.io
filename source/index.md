I am a member of the [TELOS collaboration](https://telos-collaboration.github.io/).

At [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/), I am part of the [Particle Physics and Cosmology Theory (PPCT)](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/physics/research-and-impact/particle-physics-cosmology/) group in the [Department of Physics](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/physics/).

I was a member of the [FWF](https://www.fwf.ac.at/de/) funded research group [FG1 *Strongly Interacting Dark Matter*](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/hephy/research/research-networks). At the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/) I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Axel Maas](https://homepage.uni-graz.at/de/axel.maas/).
